😎ABOUT THE PROJECT

My counter application simply provides the opportunity to add or remove numbers, and the display of these numbers is updated through a function that refreshes with each change in the number.

🔢HOW IT WORKS

There is a variable count that gets updated based on the button clicked. For example, if I click on +100, the count variable will increase its value by 100. Through a calculation logic, it will display the number on a screen. Additionally, there is a reset button that will set the count variable to 0.

📖REMEMBER

counterControlSlot[1] is the Container Reset counterControlSlot[2] is the Container up counterControlSlot[3] is the Container down

buttonPlus[0] is for count+1; buttonPlus[1] is for count+10; buttonPlus[2] is for count+100; buttonPlus[3] is for count+1000;

buttonDown[0] is for count-1; buttonDown[1] is for count-10; buttonDown[2] is for count-100; buttonDown[3] is for count-1000;
